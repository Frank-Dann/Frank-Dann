- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frank-Dann
- 👀 I’m interested in project management, change management and cloud computing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about how cloud platforms are actually build on operated 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building infrastructures and services which are needed to run cloud applications  
- 📫 You can reach me via LinkedIn or Frank.Dannenhauer@iCloud.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: apart from learning how to build cloud platforms, I also learn building non-virtual, real, brick and mortar houses in an energy efficient way
